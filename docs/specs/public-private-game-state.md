# Spec: Public / Private Game State

**Status:** approved
**Branch:** claude/public-private-game-state-s0VPh
**Last updated:** 2026-03-15

## Problem

The platform broadcasts the full `rooms.game_state` JSONB blob to every player in a room after every action and on reconnect. A player can open browser DevTools → Network → WS tab and read other players' private data (e.g. dice values in Liar's Dice). FR-MOD-10 placed visibility responsibility on each game as client-side UI filtering — but the raw data still reached every client.

## Non-Goals (v1)

- Spectator accounts (not yet a platform feature)
- Action log privacy
- Replay / history redaction
- Server-side encryption of state at rest

## Design

### Core mechanism

A projection layer is inserted at the SignalR broadcast boundary in `GameDispatcher`. Games opt in by overriding a single virtual method.

**`IGameModule`** (`src/Meepliton.Contracts/IGameModule.cs`) gains two default interface members:

```csharp
bool HasStateProjection => false;
JsonDocument? ProjectStateForPlayer(JsonDocument fullState, string playerId) => null;
```

Default implementations return `false` / `null` — no behaviour change for existing games.

**`ReducerGameModule<TState,TAction,TOptions>`** (`src/Meepliton.Contracts/ReducerGameModule.cs`) gains:

```csharp
public virtual bool HasStateProjection => false;
protected virtual TState? ProjectForPlayer(TState fullState, string playerId) => default;
```

When a subclass overrides `ProjectForPlayer`, it should also override `HasStateProjection` to return `true`. The base class implements `IGameModule.ProjectStateForPlayer` by deserialising `fullState`, calling `ProjectForPlayer`, and serialising the result back to `JsonDocument`. If `ProjectForPlayer` returns `default`, the method returns `null` (triggering full-state fallback in the dispatcher).

**`GameDispatcher`** (`src/Meepliton.Api/Services/GameDispatcher.cs`) after persisting state:

- If `module.HasStateProjection == false` → `Clients.Group(roomId).SendAsync("StateUpdated", newState)` (unchanged)
- If `module.HasStateProjection == true` → load `RoomPlayers` for the room, iterate, call `module.ProjectStateForPlayer(fullState, playerId)` per player, send via `Clients.User(playerId).SendAsync("StateUpdated", projectedState)`

Exposes a public helper: `ProjectStateForPlayer(string gameId, JsonDocument fullState, string playerId)` — used by both the fan-out path and the reconnect path to avoid duplicated logic.

**`GameHub`** (`src/Meepliton.Api/Hubs/GameHub.cs`) `JoinRoom` method: calls `dispatcher.ProjectStateForPlayer(...)` before sending state to the reconnecting client when projection is active.

### Projection contract

`ProjectStateForPlayer` / `ProjectForPlayer` **must** be:

- **Pure** — no side effects, no I/O, no mutation of shared state
- **Deterministic** — same inputs → same output
- **Cheap** — O(state size), no I/O, no allocations beyond the returned value
- **Non-mutating** — must operate on a deep copy or construct a new record; must not mutate the input `fullState`

### Spectators and unknown player IDs

`GameDispatcher` fans out only to IDs present in `RoomPlayers`. If `ProjectStateForPlayer` is called with a player ID not found in the game state, the game should return a maximally restricted projection (treat as an observer who knows only public information). This is the correct behaviour for eliminated players who remain in `RoomPlayers`.

### Persistence

`rooms.game_state` always stores the full, unfiltered state. No migration required. Projection is a read-time, transport-only operation.

### Frontend

`GameContext<TState>` is unchanged. The `state` field simply contains whatever the server sent — full or projected. Games that previously did client-side visibility filtering should remove that filtering once server-side projection is implemented.

## Liar's Dice implementation

`LiarsDiceModule` overrides `ProjectForPlayer`:

| Phase | Requesting player | All other players |
|---|---|---|
| Bidding | Full `dice` array intact | `dice` replaced with `[]`; `diceCount` preserved |
| Reveal | Full state | Full state |
| Finished | Full state | Full state |

Unknown/spectator player ID: treated as Bidding with maximally restricted projection (all dice hidden).

The existing client-side `isMe` dice filtering in the Liar's Dice frontend component is removed — the server now provides the correct state.

## Acceptance Criteria

| # | Criterion |
|---|---|
| AC-1 | Group broadcast unchanged when `HasStateProjection == false` (all existing games unaffected) |
| AC-2 | Per-player fan-out via `Clients.User` when `HasStateProjection == true` |
| AC-3 | `GameHub.JoinRoom` sends projected state on reconnect |
| AC-4 | Liar's Dice: requesting player sees own dice; all others' `dice` are empty; `diceCount` visible for all — during Bidding |
| AC-5 | Liar's Dice: full state returned for all players during Reveal/Finished |
| AC-6 | Spectator/unknown player ID receives maximally restricted projection |
| AC-7 | Integration test: two `HubConnection` clients via `WebApplicationFactory`, assert Player B's `StateUpdated` payload does not contain Player A's dice during Bidding |
| AC-8 | `ProjectStateForPlayer` / `ProjectForPlayer` documented as pure, deterministic, side-effect-free |
| AC-9 | ADR-010 written; FR-MOD-10 updated in `docs/requirements.md` |
| AC-10 | Liar's Dice spec updated; client-side filtering decision superseded |
| AC-11 | `dispatcher.ProjectStateForPlayer(gameId, fullState, playerId)` is the single shared projection path — no duplicated logic between fan-out and reconnect |
